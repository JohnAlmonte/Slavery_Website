                <h1>HOW SLAVERY STARTED</h1>
                <p>Slavery in America began in the early 17th century, primarily with the arrival of African slaves in the English colonies. The first documented African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619, where they were initially treated similarly to indentured servants. However, as the demand for labor grew, especially in the tobacco and later cotton industries, slavery became increasingly institutionalized. The transatlantic slave trade played a crucial role in bringing enslaved Africans to the American colonies, with millions being forcibly transported to work on plantations, primarily in the South. Over time, laws were passed to enforce racial slavery, turning it into a system that lasted for over two centuries, deeply entrenching racial inequality in American society.</p>

                <h1>HOW SLAVERY WAS ERADICATED</h1>
                <p>Slavery in America was gradually eradicated through a combination of factors, including legal, social, and political movements. The abolitionist movement, which gained momentum in the early 19th century, played a central role, with figures like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and William Lloyd Garrison advocating for the emancipation of enslaved people. The issue of slavery became a major point of contention between the North, where it was mostly abolished, and the South, which relied heavily on slave labor for its agricultural economy. Tensions reached a boiling point with the Civil War (1861â€“1865), in which the Northern Union fought against the Southern Confederacy.

                    The turning point came in 1863 with President Abraham Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all enslaved people in Confederate states to be free. However, full abolition was not achieved until the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1865, which permanently abolished slavery in all states. This legal change was further reinforced by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, which sought to address the lingering racial inequalities that slavery had left behind.</p>
